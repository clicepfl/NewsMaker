## Compilation:

The easy way to compile the project is to use Maven with jdk 18 (you can also use the Maven integration in IntellIJ).

The command for compiling the project is:<br>
**mvn compile**

and for creating the .jar (in the target directory):<br>
**mvn package**

ensure that the .jar named with *-shaded* at the end is executable and then it is ready to be used !
